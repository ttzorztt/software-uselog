- Q: nconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentationPylance
 > A: Because you used spaces and tabs at the same times,but python don't allow you use simultaneously space and tabs,so you can use tab all the time or only use space, and you can click menu like View, then you can select Render Whitespace, this menu can render space and tabs, so you can easy to diffence them, and save this problem
