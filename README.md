- LaTex Workshop
    If you have texlive, use vs-code instead of texstudio, I think you will be intimidated by this plugin, it can show you some latex symbols, as well as code highlighting and code hinting, but I think it has one drawback of mine. AutoBuild, this plugin will rebuild if you change the tex file, you can stop it by setting.

## permissions errer ##
- **Insufficient permissions. Select 'Retry as Sudo' to retry as superuser.**
    This means you don't have enough permissions to save this file, you should check if this file was created by you, if you didn't create this file, you won't be able to change this file. And you can use like this:
    ```shell
    sudo chmod -R 777 [dir]
    ```
    This action allows other users to change the directory.
## python errer ##
- **nconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentationPylance**
Because you used spaces and tabs at the same times,but python don't allow you use simultaneously space and tabs,so you can use tab all the time or only use space, and you can click menu like View, then you can select Render Whitespace, this menu can render space and tabs, so you can easy to diffence them, and save this problem
